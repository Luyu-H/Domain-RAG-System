In addition, multiple exon skipping could be used to select deletions that optimize the functionality of the truncated dystrophin protein. Theoretically, multiple exon skipping could be used to treat approximately 90%, 80%, and 98% of DMD patients with deletion, duplication, and nonsense mutations, respectively. One major challenge has been its limited applicability."

In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. The cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. These glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate, ketone bodies and chemical building blocks, such as amino acids -glutamine-, and nucleotides) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells. Lactate and ketones drive cancer cell  oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Therefore, according to the \"reverse Warburg effect\", stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer.

Inhibition of EGFR with monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab has become a standard treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, not all patients with mCRC respond to EGFR inhibitors, and the predictive value of epiregulin and amphiregulin expression for response to cetuximab has not been well characterized. In a study of 100 patients with mCRC, high tumor mRNA levels of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) were associated with anti-EGFR agent response in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In contrast, low tumor mRNA levels of AREG and EREG were associated with poor response to cetuximab.

        "Epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG) are ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and their overexpression may indicate EGFR dependency in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), regardless of tumor sidedness. High AREG/EREG expression is associated with sensitivity to EGFR blockade, particularly in patients with right-sided tumors and a lack of genomic drivers of primary resistance beyond RAS and BRAF mutations. The expression of AREG and EREG is positively correlated with a response to EGFR-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer. Gene-body methylation sites, which show a strong inverse correlation with AREG and EREG gene expression, have been identified in cell lines and human colorectal cancer samples. Treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-desoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, results in decreased methylation and increased AREG and EREG gene expression. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) overexpression in colon cancer cells has been shown to upregulate EGFR signaling, secrete EGFR ligands such as AREG, and promote tumor growth. FGFR4 overexpression also reduces cetuximab-induced cytotoxicity, while the combination of an FGFR4 inhibitor and cetuximab has shown profound antitumor effects. Clinically, there is a positive correlation between FGFR4 and AREG expression in tumor tissue, but not in normal tissue, from colon cancer patients. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of baseline plasma AREG levels in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF wild-type metastatic CRC on treatment outcome with palliative first-line cetuximab + FOLFIRI chemotherapy. The results showed that high baseline plasma AREG levels were significantly associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with cetuximab-based therapy. Additionally, in vitro studies using CRC cell lines sensitive to cetuximab showed that AREG decreased the anti-proliferative effect of cetuximab via AKT and ERK activation. However, after acquiring cetuximab resistance, AREG did not increase colony formation or activate AKT and ERK after cetuximab treatment.

Moreover, EP4 signaling induced expression of amphiregulin and epiregulin in activated macrophages, whereas EP4 pathway was required for basal expression of epiregulin in gastric epithelial cells. In contrast, ADAMs were not induced directly by EP4 signaling. The role of nuclear EGFR in tumors is not well understood, although many EGFR ligands are upregulated in cancers.

Predictive information for anti-EGFR treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was observed, but data for other agents is limited.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ligand mRNA expression; RAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations; and EGFR expression were assessed by qRT-PCR, pyrosequencing, and IHC, respectively, in mCRC tumor tissue of patients participating in the randomized controlled trials FIRE-1, CIOX, and FIRE-3. Normalized mRNA expression was dichotomized using median and third quartile. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method including univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of baseline plasma AREG levels in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) on treatment outcome with palliative first-line cetuximab + FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Chemotherapy outcomes were analyzed based on baseline plasma AREG levels. The clinical findings were further validated using an in vitro model of CRC. Among 35 patients, the progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly inferior in patients with high AREG than in those with low AREG levels: 10.9 vs. 24.2 months, respectively (p = 0.008). However, after failure of first-line chemotherapy, AREG levels were associated with neither PFS (4.8 vs. 11.6 months; p = 0.215) nor overall survival (8.4 vs. 13.3 months; p = 0.975). In SNU-C4 and Caco-2 cells which were relatively sensitive to cetuximab among the seven CRC cell lines tested, AREG significantly decreased the anti-proliferative effect of cetuximab (p < 0.05) via AKT and ERK activation. However, after acquiring cetuximab resistance with gradual exposure for more than 6 months, AREG neither increased colony formation nor activated AKT and ERK after cetuximab treatment.",

No patients had ever received anti-EGFR antibody agents. AREG and EREG mRNA expression from both the primary tumor and liver metastases were measured using real-time RT-PCR. KRAS codon 12, 13 mutation status was analyzed by direct sequencing.RESULTS: Modest, but significant, correlations were observed between primary tumor and corresponding liver metastases in both AREG mRNA expression (Rs = 0.54, p < 0.0001) and EREG mRNA expression (Rs = 0.58, p < 0.0001). AREG and EREG mRNA expression was strongly correlated in both the primary tumor (Rs = 0.81, p < 0.0001) and the liver metastases (Rs = 0.87, p < 0.0001). No significant survival difference was observed between low and high AREG or EREG patients when all 120 patients were analyzed.

Recently, various biomarkers were reported to be useful in predicting resistance to anti-EGFR. All the potential biomarkers predicting resistance to anti-EGFR are reviewed herein from five aspects. First, upstream molecules, including epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG), might play different roles according to their abnormal levels in tumor tissue and serum. Second, the EGFR amplification and distinct polymorphisms may have roles in identifying patients for initial anti-EGFR mAbs therapy, while rare EGFR mutations have limited predictive values. Third, among the downstream molecularly related factors, rat sarcoma viral oncogene (Ras) has been identified as a successful predictor, while B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) is considered as a prognostic factor rather than a predictor.",

Compared with placebo, topical minoxidil caused significant increases in LV end-diastolic volume, in cardiac output (by 0.751 min-1) and in LV mass (by 5 g m-2). We conclude that in healthy subjects short-term use of topical minoxidil is likely not to be detrimental. However, safety needs to be established regarding ischaemic symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease as well as for the possible development of LV hypertrophy in healthy subjects during years of therapy.",

One of the subjects who was using extemporaneous topical minoxidil had hypertension and arteriosclerotic disease and the other died of a myocardial infarction.

Recent advances in bisulfite sequencing allow detection of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) achieving high sensitivity, but accurately identifying heterozygous SNVs from partially C-to-T converted sequences remains challenging.Results: We designed two methods, BayesWC and BinomWC, that substantially improved the precision of heterozygous SNV calls from ∼80% to 99% while retaining comparable recalls. With these SNV calls, we provided functions for allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) analysis and visualizing the methylation status on reads. Applying ASM analysis to a previous dataset, we found that an average of 1.5% of investigated regions showed allelic methylation, which were significantly enriched in transposon elements and likely to be shared by the same cell-type. A dynamic fragment strategy was utilized for DMR analysis in low-coverage data and was able to find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) related to key genes involved in tumorigenesis using a public cancer dataset. Finally, we integrated 40 applications into the software package CGmapTools to analyze DNA methylomes. This package uses CGmap as the format interface, and designs binary formats to reduce the file size and support fast data retrieval, and can be applied for context-wise, gene-wise, bin-wise, region-wise and sample-wise analyses and visualizations.Availability and implementation: The CGmapTools software is freely available at https://cgmaptools.github.io/.",

A two-compartment linear PK model with first-order absorption and lag time best described mezigdomide PK profiles in HSs.

Mezigdomide is a novel cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase modulator with potent antiproliferative and tumoricidal activity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma, including those resistant to lenalidomide and pomalidomide.METHODS: In this phase 1-2 study, we administered oral mezigdomide in combination with dexamethasone to patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. The primary objectives of phase 1 (dose-escalation cohort) were to assess safety and pharmacokinetics and to identify the dose and schedule for phase 2. In phase 2 (dose-expansion cohort), objectives included the assessment of the overall response (partial response or better), safety, and efficacy of mezigdomide plus dexamethasone at the dose and schedule determined in phase 1.RESULTS: In phase 1, a total of 77 patients were enrolled in the study. The most common dose-limiting toxic effects were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. On the basis of the phase 1 findings, investigators determined the recommended phase 2 dose of mezigdomide to be 1.0 mg, given once daily in combination with dexamethasone for 21 days, followed by 7 days off, in each 28-day cycle. In phase 2, a total of 101 patients received the dose identified in phase 1 in the same schedule. All patients in the dose-expansion cohort had triple-class-refractory multiple myeloma, 30 patients (30%) had received previous anti-B-cell maturation antigen (anti-BCMA) therapy, and 40 (40%) had plasmacytomas. The most common adverse events, almost all of which proved to be reversible, included neutropenia (in 77% of the patients) and infection (in 65%; grade 3, 29%; grade 4, 6%). No unexpected toxic effects were encountered. An overall response occurred in 41% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 31 to 51), the median duration of response was 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.5; data not mature), and the median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.5), with a median follow-up of 7.5 ",

          "text": "Mammalian genomes encode tens of thousands of noncoding RNAs. Most noncoding transcripts exhibit nuclear localization and several have been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. To investigate the function of such RNAs, methods to massively map the genomic interacting sites of multiple transcripts have been developed; however, these methods have some limitations. Here, we introduce RNA And DNA Interacting Complexes Ligated and sequenced (RADICL-seq), a technology that maps genome-wide RNA-chromatin interactions in intact nuclei. RADICL-seq is a proximity ligation-based methodology that reduces the bias for nascent transcription, while increasing genomic coverage and unique mapping rate efficiency compared with existing methods. RADICL-seq identifies distinct patterns of genome occupancy for different classes of transcripts as well as cell type-specific RNA-chromatin interactions, and highlights the role of transcription in the establishment of chromatin structure.",

The median age increased from 35.5 months in the earlier period to 80.5 months (P = .007). Overall, H influenzae type b was identified as the causative organism in 76% of patients, but in only 25% of the cases since 1990 (P = .004). Of the eight cases from 1990 through 1992, three had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus isolated from a surface culture of the epiglottis; three other cases of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus were identified earlier.

        "Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has an important role in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels and a large number of human behaviors. For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether a cumulative genetic score (CGS) containing the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and the human serotonin transporter gene linked polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) was associated with IPV perpetration after accounting for the effects of alcohol problems, drug problems, age, and length of relationship. One approach to this question is examining allelic variation in the X-linked monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, previously associated with impulsive aggression in animals and humans. Allelic variation of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been implicated in conduct disorder and antisocial, aggressive behavior in humans when associated with early adverse experiences.",

Nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and regulatory mechanism of T-UCRs in lung cancer (LC) remain largely unknown. We found that uc.454 was downregulated in both non-small-cell LC (NSCLC) tissues and LC cell lines, and the downregulated uc.454 is associated with tumor size and tumors with more advanced stages.

        "Epigenetic modifications are molecular changes that affect gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Some major examples of epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA alterations. DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases in the DNA molecule, often leading to gene silencing. Histone modifications encompass various chemical changes to histone proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, which can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the specific modification and its location. Chromatin remodeling refers to structural changes in chromatin that influence the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Non-coding RNA alterations involve small RNA molecules like microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally or through other mechanisms. These epigenetic modifications play crucial roles in various biological processes and have been implicated in the development of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer.",

Functional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion. Recently, we found that aPKC can also phosphorylate Par6 to drive EMT and increase the migratory potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells. We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. Knockdown of Numb by shRNA in MDCK cells led to a lateral to apical translocation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, active F-actin polymerization, mis-localization of Par3 and aPKC, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and an increase in cell migration and proliferation.

In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user. In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed). We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode.",

In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve>99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations.",

This has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed and transmitted. To facilitate this effort, we propose a new lossy compressor for the quality values presented in genomic data files (e.g. FASTQ and SAM files), which comprise roughly half of the storage space (in the uncompressed domain). Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit.RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case. Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms. Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained.",

        "Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer). Other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.\nEarly breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. These changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.\nIn some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.\nA small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. Hereditary cancers are those associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to occur earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases and are more likely to involve both breasts.\n\nVariations of the BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCT, and P53 genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\nThe and NFR2, HER2 and TOP2A genes are associated with breast cancer."

        "Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways.In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes.",

One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways.",

OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters.

In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration."

In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.",
