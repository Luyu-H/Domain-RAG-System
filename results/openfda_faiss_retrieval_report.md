## Detailed Query Analysis

### Query 1: Side Effects and Warnings for Acetaminophen and Codeine Combination Drugs

**Query**: "What are the side effects and warnings for acetaminophen and codeine combination drugs?"

**Performance Metrics**:
- Precision: 0.000
- Recall: 0.000
- F1 Score: 0.000
- Query Time: 0.053 seconds

**Problem Analysis**:
- ❌ Failed to retrieve any ground truth documents
- Retrieved results are all single-ingredient acetaminophen products, not combination drugs
- Lacks ability to identify "codeine" keywords
- Retrieved documents focus on pain relief rather than side effects and warnings

**Retrieval Quality Assessment**:
- Retrieved documents contain "acetaminophen" but are all single-ingredient products
- Lacks understanding of "codeine" and "combination" keywords
- Document content focuses on indications rather than side effects and warnings

### Query 2: Dosage Recommendations for ADHD Medications in Children

**Query**: "What are the dosage recommendations for ADHD medications in children?"

**Performance Metrics**:
- Precision: 0.100
- Recall: 0.500
- F1 Score: 0.167
- Query Time: 0.028 seconds

**Success Case**:
- ✅ Successfully retrieved 1 ground truth document (0cf87661-ee5a-e1d5-e063-6294a90ae270)
- This document contains detailed ADHD medication dosage information

**Problem Analysis**:
- Only retrieved 1 ground truth document, missing another relevant document
- Retrieved results include irrelevant children's cough medications

**Retrieval Quality Assessment**:
- Partial success: Found the correct ADHD medication document
- Document content is highly relevant to the query, containing specific dosage recommendations
- But retrieval scope is not comprehensive enough

### Query 3: Active Ingredients in Topical Pain Relief Medications

**Query**: "What are the active ingredients in topical pain relief medications?"

**Performance Metrics**:
- Precision: 0.000
- Recall: 0.000
- F1 Score: 0.000
- Query Time: 0.295 seconds

**Problem Analysis**:
- ❌ Failed to retrieve any ground truth documents
- Retrieved results are all topical anesthetics (lidocaine) and menthol products
- Lacks ability to identify specific active ingredients (capsaicin, sunscreen ingredients)

**Retrieval Quality Assessment**:
- Retrieved documents are all topical products, but ingredients don't match the query
- Lacks understanding of "topical pain relief" and specific active ingredients
- Retrieval results are too broad, lacking precision

### Query 4: Indications and Usage for Fluocinolone Acetonide Oil

**Query**: "What are the indications and usage for fluocinolone acetonide oil?"

**Performance Metrics**:
- Precision: 0.100
- Recall: 1.000
- F1 Score: 0.182
- Query Time: 0.055 seconds

**Success Case**:
- ✅ Successfully retrieved ground truth document (1785d85e-edcf-44cc-b84e-a7beb1e5d7b6)
- Document content highly matches the query

**Retrieval Quality Assessment**:
- Complete success: Found the correct document
- Document contains detailed indications and usage information
- High keyword matching, excellent retrieval quality

### Query 5: Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Warnings for Drug Use

**Query**: "What are the pregnancy and breastfeeding warnings for drug use?"

**Performance Metrics**:
- Precision: 0.000
- Recall: 0.000
- F1 Score: 0.000
- Query Time: 0.010 seconds

**Problem Analysis**:
- ❌ Failed to retrieve any ground truth documents
- Retrieved results are completely irrelevant, including homeopathic products
- Lacks ability to identify "pregnancy" and "breastfeeding" keywords

**Retrieval Quality Assessment**:
- Retrieved results completely mismatch the query
- Lacks understanding of specific warning information
- Extremely poor retrieval quality

## Main Problem Analysis

### 1. Keyword Matching Issues
- Insufficient understanding of compound keywords
- Lack of precise identification of medical terminology
- Limited ability to handle synonyms and near-synonyms

### 2. Semantic Understanding Limitations
- Insufficient depth in understanding query intent
- Lack of understanding of drug classification and characteristics
- Insufficient understanding of medical document structure

### 3. Retrieval Precision Issues
- Retrieval results are too broad
- Lack of distinction between specific drug types
- Insufficient understanding of document content

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Model Optimization
- Use medical domain-specific pre-trained models
- Consider using larger embedding models
- Implement domain adaptation techniques

### 2. Query Processing
- Implement query expansion techniques
- Add synonym and medical terminology dictionaries
- Use query rewriting techniques

### 3. Retrieval Strategy
- Implement hybrid retrieval methods (vector + keyword)
- Add document type filtering
- Implement re-ranking mechanisms

### 4. Evaluation Improvements
- Add more test queries
- Implement manual evaluation
- Add relevance scoring mechanisms

## Conclusion

The FAISS vector retrieval system shows significant problems on OpenFDA data:

1. **Low Overall Performance**: Average F1 score of only 0.070, indicating retrieval quality needs significant improvement
2. **Query Specificity Issues**: Insufficient understanding of specific medical queries
3. **Retrieval Precision Problems**: Low match between retrieval results and query intent

Although it performs well on some simple queries (like Query 4), overall it requires systematic improvements to meet medical information retrieval needs. It is recommended to adopt hybrid retrieval methods that combine the advantages of vector retrieval and traditional keyword retrieval.
